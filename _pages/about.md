I’m a Research Scientist at Samsung AI Lab Montreal, 
leading research on graph neural networks, large language models and optimization,
with applications in *reasoning and scientific discovery*.
I'm also an Adjunct Professor at University of Montreal, 
focusing on [Weight Space Learning](https://weight-space-learning.github.io/).

I received my PhD in Engineering from University of Guelph (ON, Canada) in 2022, 
under the supervision of Graham Taylor. 
My dissertation was on *Assessing and Improving Generalization in Graph Reasoning and Learning*.
